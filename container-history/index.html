# `chroot`
- "Change root" -- changes the apparent root directory and so cannot access files/commands outside
- First mention of `chroot` appears to be _Version 7 Unix_ in 1979
- Added to BSD by Bill Joy on 18 March 1982 – 17 months before 4.2BSD was released – in order to test its installation and build system
- Easy to 'bounce out' of the filesystem (TODO)

# `chroot` jails
- A security mechanism
- Used for running code that is dubious
- Why would anyone run 'dubious' code (TODO)?

# OS Virtualization
- Sun introduced 'zones'
- A great way of selling really *big* servers
- Required OS modification (TODO)

# IBM 1401
- Everyone was writing code to run on the IBM 1401

# New hardware came along (TODO)

# The 'Liberator'
- Honeywell 200 introduced in the early 1960s to 'liberate' people from IBM
- Could execute IBM 1401 programs without re-compilation or re-assembly
---
template: default

# System 360
- Offered an emulation mode to run IBM 1401 code
- Emulation used a combination of hardware, microcode and an emulation program
- Sysetm had to be halted to boot into this emulation program
