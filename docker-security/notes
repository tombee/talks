Lots of negative comments on Docker
- "Containers don't contain"
  https://opensource.com/business/14/7/docker-security-selinux

- "... total systematic failure of all logic related to image security"
  https://titanous.com/posts/docker-insecurity

- The shared surface between applications is now the kernel
- Denial of service of resources (cpu, memory, storage)
- Poisoned images
- Secrets management?


- Container breakouts are treated as unlikely but possible, cgroups and namespaces are relatively new -- we're probably going to see exploits
    - Use VMs to segregate groups of containers

- Docker privileges == root privileges
- If you're using the Docker remote API, only allow access via TLS with authenticate client on AND only listen on internal network/VPN

- Users are not namespaced (yet!), root in container == root on host
- Don't run your applications as root:
    RUN groupadd -r nobody && useradd -r -g nobody nobody
    USER nobody

- Set container FS to read-only
    docker run --read-only debian bash touch /test

- Set bind mounted volumes to read-only:
    docker run -v $(pwd):/data debian touch /data/test

- SELinux/AppArmor

- Set cpu shares
    docker run -d myimage
    docker run -d -c 512 myimage

- set memory limits
    docker run -m 512m myimage

- Disable inter-container communication (but retain link communication)
    docker daemon --icc="false" --iptables="true"

- Using Docker Hub images
    - Only use images that come from someone you trust
    - Automated builds and linked Dockerfile that you can inspect
    - Docker pull by digest:
        docker pull debian@....

- Package vulnerabilities & system binaries
    $ find / -perm +6000 -type f -exec ls -ld {} \;
    - Run a minimal distribution to reduce attack surface

- The real issue is application vulnerabilities

- Investigation of an attack
    $ docker diff my_container
    .. Okay, we see something changed?
    $ docker commit my_container
    abcdef1234567890
    $ docker kill my_container
    $ docker run new_container
    $ docker run abcdef1234567890 /bin/bash


- Secrets
    - Bake into image: NO!
    - Environment variables -- can inspect them
    - Volumes -- too much hassle
    - KV store
