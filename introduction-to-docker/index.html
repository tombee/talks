# What is Docker?
---
template: inverse

## Let's take a look at modern application development...
---
template: default

# Agile Development
- Small teams
- Focus on delivering the MVP
- Short iterations (sprints)
- Continuous Deployment/Delivery
---
template: default

# Microservices
- Polyglot platforms
- Many languages
- Simultaneous use of SQL, NoSQL
- The right tool for the job
---
template: default

# Cloud
- Deploy our microservices to lots of VMs
- Cloud Providers: AWS, DigitalOcean, Azure &amp; OpenStack
- HA, clustered environments &amp; elastic scaling
- 12 Factor Apps (http://12factor.net/)
---
template: default

# How do we manage this today?
- VMs for development, using tools like Vagrant 
- DevOps expertise for deploying to VMs in the cloud
- Isolating apps in their own VMs
- Configuration Management (Ansible, Fabric, Chef, Puppet)
- Lots of patience :) 
---
# So what's the problem?
---
template: default
# Complex development environments

- Lots of different applications and dependencies are required for polyglot platforms, running at specific versions
- Maybe you even need multiple versions of the same applications installed, e.g. 
  - Java 1.7 &amp; Maven 2 for App A 
  - Java 1.8 &amp; Maven 3.3 for App B
--

- **Solution**: Create a VM that has all this stuff and distribute this around on a USB stick :)

---
template: default

# Virtual Machine Management
- **Size**: VMs their images are large, impractical to store/transfer
- **Performance**: 
    - VMs come with a hardware virtualization overhead
    - An OS install per VM
    - Slow boot-up time
- **Portability**: vmdk vs. vdi vs. ami
- **Hardware-centric**: Tooling is focused on machine operators
---
template: default

# Configuration Management
- State management is **hard**, especially in the dynamic environments of today
- End up with complex shellscripts, cookbooks, playbooks to manage the installation, upgrade and removal of each component
- Transient failures -- we couldn't get a particular package at the moment.. now what?
- Installing dependencies every time you want to provision something new is often slow

## Build, ship and run...  Any app, anywhere
---
template: default

# Docker Engine
- The core docker component
- A single binary that is both the CLI client __and__ the daemon
- Builds, creates and manages containers
---
# Container
## *an object for holding or transporting something*
---
template: default

# Docker Containers
- The standard unit in which an application can reside
- Packages an app and its dependencies together
- Isolated from other containers
- One container per app / service
---
template: inverse

# Demo
## Containers in Action 
---
template: default

# What just happened?
- The `ubuntu` image provides a rootfs, along with a set of userland tools that we are familiar with, e.g. `apt-get`, `bash`, `ifconfig`, etc. (These are often required to get our application's dependencies installed)
- We have an isolated workspace that has:
  - Its own filesystem
  - Its own process namespace
  - Its own network stack
---
template: default

# How does it work?
- Kernel mechanisms are used to create the isolated workspace
  - namespaces (filesystem, process and network)
  - cgroups for resource management
- copy-on-write: Docker uses a union filesystem -- this means that containers often will never need to write to disk
---
# "Docker is like chroot on steroids"
---
template: inverse

# Demo
## Images in Action 
---
template: default

# Building Images
- A `Dockerfile` is a recipe that describes the build process, it follows a familiar shell scripting approach
- Incremental builds are fast (caching)
- Reproducible, we start `FROM` a known state 
---
template: default

# Image format
- Images consist of layers,  each layer is a diff from the layer beneath it
- Each build step (`RUN`, `ADD`, `ENV`) becomes a layer in the built image
- Layers are hash-chained together, a change to a layer invalidates all layers above it
- The hash-chain forms a cache
---
template: default

# Image Distribution
- Images are named: `<user>/<name>:<tag>`
- We store them in a registry (Hub, DTR or private registry)
- Image layers are transferred to/from a registry using the REST API
  - `docker push` to send and image to a registry
  - `docker pull` to request an image from a registry
- Only **new** layers are transferred
---
template: inverse

# Demo
## Docker Hub in Action 
---
template: default

# Ecosystem: Images
- ~100 official images
- Linux distros (Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, ...)
- Components (MySQL, Redis, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Logstash, Tomcat, NGINX...)
- Languages (Python, Ruby, Java, Go, Node...)
- Applications (Wordpress...)
- ~150,000 contributed images

# Docker Machine
## Machine lets you create Docker hosts on your computer, on cloud providers, and inside your own data center.
---
template: default

# Supported Providers
- virtualbox
- ec2 
- azure
- digitalocean 
- google 
- openstack 
- rackspace
- vmwarevsphere
---
template: default

# Machine and boot2docker
- This is an essential part of the Docker Toolbox for Windows/OSX users
- Machine provides users an easy way of creating a Docker/Linux VM
- The image used for these local VMs is boot2docker
- boot2docker is based on tinylinux and provides a fully functional Docker engine
---
template: default

# docker-machine
- We can create a Docker engine locally like so:

```shell
$ docker-machine create -d virtualbox tom
```

- This allows us to then "point" our Docker client at it

```shell
$ eval $(docker-machine env tom)
$ docker info
```

---
template: default

# Cloud Provisioning
- An example of provisioning on Amazon

```shell
$ docker-machine create -d amazonec2 \
    --amazonec2-vpc-id="vpc-524c6037" \
    demo
```

- We can now securely interact with our public cloud engine:

```shell
$ eval $(docker-machine env demo)
$ docker info
```
---
template: inverse

# Docker Compose
## Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container applications with Docker.
---
template: default

# docker-compose.yml
- A manifest that describes a collection of *services* that make up an *application*
- An example compose file:

```
web:
  image: tombee/counter
  ports:
   - "80:5000"
  links:
   - redis
redis:
  image: redis
```

---
template: default

# docker-compose.yml build steps
- We can also define services that include a build step:

```
web:
  build: .  &lt;-- use Dockerfile in current directory 
  ports:
   - "80:5000"
  links:
   - redis
redis:
  image: redis
```
---
template: default

# docker-compose CLI
- Run any build steps:

```shell
$ docker-compose build
```

- To start the services:

```shell
$ docker-compose up
```

- Stop the services

```shell
$ docker-compose stop
```

---

# Docker Swarm
## Docker Swarm is native clustering for Docker. It allows you create and access to a pool of Docker hosts using the full suite of Docker tools. 
---
template: default
# Installation
- Windows: <a href="https://www.docker.com/toolbox">https://www.docker.com/toolbox</a>
