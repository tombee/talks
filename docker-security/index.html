# "The only truly secure system is one that is powered off, cast in a block of concrete and sealed in a lead-lined room with armed guards - and even then I have my doubts."

# But that's not very practical..
- Security is a spectrum, where on the spectrum is often due to multiple factors
--

  - Data sensitivity
--

  - Attack surface/Accessibility
--

  - Cost

  - Performance

# Microservices
- Lots of small applications that work together, rather than a monolith
--

- We like to isolate applications for practical, dependency &amp; security reasons
--

- Isolation is often achieved by VMs, but this this can be expensive and we take a performance hit

# Application Isolation by Containers
- Each container runs 1 application, multiple containers per host
- We can retain resource, filesystem, network and process isolation
- Shared surface is the kernel
- We can group related microservices onto a single host for improved performance

# But can I rely upon containers for isolation?

# Container Breakouts
- cgroups and namespaces are relatively young
--

- I think of breakouts as "unlikely, but possible"

# Static Analysis of Containers
- This study shows that we can write code to audit *all* public images in the Hub for known security vulnerabilities 
--

- If we can write code to do it, we can automate it!
